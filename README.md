# LiPo Battery Charging Trainer

An interactive web application designed to teach safe battery charging practices for RC (Remote Control) purposes through flashcard-style learning.

## Overview

This single-page web app simulates a battery charger interface where users learn to set correct charging parameters for different battery types and configurations. The app presents random battery scenarios and validates user inputs against real-world safety standards.

## Key Features

### üì± Responsive Design

#### Hard Mode
- Parallel charging scenarios (1-4 identical batteries)
- Tests ability to calculate correct current for multiple batteries
- All batteries in a set have matching cell count and type
- Challenges understanding of parallel charging principles

### üîã Battery Visualization

#### LiPo Batteries
- Represented as stacked isometric rectangles with rounded edges
- Each rectangle represents one cell in the series
- Cell length varies based on capacity (up to a reasonable limit)
- Realistic 3D appearance with shadows and gradients

#### Li-ion Batteries
- Depicted as groups of cylindrical cells (18650 style)
- Number of cylinders matches cell count
- Consistent sizing regardless of capacity
- Authentic battery terminal details

#### Parallel Charging Display
- Multiple battery packs shown side by side
- Connected with '+' symbols to indicate parallel configuration
- Clear visual representation of multi-battery setups

### ‚ö° Realistic Charger Interface

#### Automatic Cell Detection
- Displays detected cell count (S rating) like real chargers
- Shows single battery cell count for Easy/Medium modes
- Shows cell count of one battery in parallel setups for Hard mode

#### Voltage Control
- Precision voltage setting with 0.01V increments
- Range: 3.00V to 4.50V per cell
- Plus/minus buttons for fine adjustment
- Direct number input with validation
- Monospace display for technical accuracy

#### Current Control
- Current setting with 0.1A increments
- Range: 0.1A to 10.0A
- Plus/minus buttons for easy adjustment
- Direct number input with bounds checking
- Real-time value display

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Rating System

#### LiPo Battery Safety Standards
- **1C and below**: Safe charging rate
- **1-2C**: Fast charging but low risk (monitor temperature)
- **2-3C**: Risky charging with high damage potential
- **Above 3C**: Not recommended - extremely dangerous

#### Li-ion Battery Safety Standards
- **0.5C and below**: Safe charging rate
- **0.5-1C**: Fast charging but low risk (monitor temperature)
- **Above 1C**: Not recommended for Li-ion chemistry

#### Voltage Validation
- LiPo: 4.20V per cell maximum
- Li-ion: 4.10V per cell maximum
- Incorrect voltage settings trigger danger warnings

### üé® User Interface Design

#### Modern Aesthetic
- Gradient background with professional color scheme
- Glassmorphism effects with semi-transparent elements
- Clean typography with technical monospace fonts
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions

#### Color-Coded Feedback
- **Green**: Safe charging parameters
- **Yellow**: Fast charging with caution advised
- **Orange**: Risky parameters with warnings
- **Red**: Dangerous settings with strong warnings

#### Interactive Elements
- Hover effects on all interactive components
- Visual feedback for button presses
- Smooth transitions between states
- Responsive button scaling
